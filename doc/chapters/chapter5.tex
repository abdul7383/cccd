\chapter{Implementation\label{cha:chapter5}}
This chapter deals with the implementation of the design presented in Chapter 4. It was and is not the purpose of this work to implement a market-ready product. The focus is clearly on the conceptual part. To demonstrate the general realization of the proposed design, the implementation is done therefore only in the form of a prototype.


%\section{Development Environment\label{sec:impl_ecl}}	

\section{Tools \& Technologies\label{sec:impl_tools_tech}}	
This section gives an overview on the tools and technologies that have been used to simplify the implementation. The programming languages, which have been used to implement the framework, are Java and Python.

\subsection{Tools\label{sec:impl_tools}}
The following tools have been used to simplify, organize and test the implementation.

\paragraph{Eclipse Juno 4.2 IDE:\label{sec:impl_eclipse}} Eclipse is one of the widely used IDE for Java. It makes it easier to develop Java applications. 

\paragraph{Maven 3:\label{sec:impl_maven}} Maven is an open source build automation tool developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It uses an XML file called \textit{pom.xml} to describe the software project being built, its dependencies, the build order, directories, and required plug-ins. It comes with predefined targets for performing certain well-defined tasks such as compilation of code, its packaging and how and where to deploy the project.


\paragraph{Advanced REST client:\label{sec:impl_advanced_rest_cl}} Advanced REST client is a plugin within the Chrome browser and can help developers to create and test custom HTTP requests. It has been used mainly to test the different REST API, which have been developed within the framework.

\subsection{Technologies\label{sec:impl_technologies}}
In order to not reinvent the wheel again, most of the components in the framework are based on existing open source technologies. 

\paragraph{Spring Framework 3.1.1:\label{sec:impl_spring}} As described in \ref{sec:back_sp_fr}, the Spring framework is a lightweight solution and a very good base for building enterprise-ready applications. It provides an incredibly powerful and flexible collection of technologies and projects to improve enterprise Java application development. The following are some projects from the Spring framework, which have been used in developing the framework.

\subparagraph{Spring Security 3.1.1:\label{sec:impl_spring_sec}} Spring Security is a powerful and highly customizable authentication and access-control framework. It is the de-facto standard for securing Spring-based applications.

\subparagraph{Spring Data MongoDB 1.1.0:\label{sec:impl_spring_data}} Spring Data for MongoDB is part of the umbrella Spring Data project which aims to provide a familiar and consistent Spring-based programming model for for new datastores while retaining store-specific features and capabilities. The Spring Data MongoDB project provides integration with the MongoDB document database.

\subparagraph{Spring AMQP 1.1.3:\label{sec:impl_spring_amqp}} The Spring AMQP project applies core Spring concepts to the development of AMQP-based messaging solutions. It provide a "template" as a high-level abstraction for sending and receiving messages.

\paragraph{MongoDB :\label{sec:impl_spring_sec}} Spring Security is a powerful and highly customizable authentication and access-control framework. It is the de-facto standard for securing Spring-based applications.
